This repository contains a “single, reusable R script” that performs one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test for “any continuous soil indicator” across urbanization regions.

## Supported indicators
The same script can be used for different indicator.

## Grouping variable
- `region`: Urban classification with four levels  
  - `UC`: Urban Center  
  - `SUBC`: Subcenter  
  - `SUB`: Suburb  
  - `EX`: Exurb  
  (Must be stored as a factor in your data)

## How to use
1. Place your data file (`your_data.csv`) in the same folder as the R script.
2. Open `anova_tukey_analysis.R` in RStudio.
3. “To analyze a specific indicator”, modify this line in the script:
 
    Change "SOC" to your target column name
Change "region" to your target column name(e.g., different treatments)
